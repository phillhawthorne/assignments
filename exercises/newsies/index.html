            <h2>Florida man claims wife was kidnapped by holograms</h2>
                <p>A 53-year-old man from Florida’s Martin County told deputies late 
                last month that intruders had abducted his wife with the assistance
                of “holograms”. </p>
                <p>The man, whose name has not been released, was “extremely agitated” and holding a baseball bat when officials arrived. He told them that “the men” 
                abducted his wife and that “they used holograms to project signals on the walls to get him to do what they wanted and to communicate with each other,”
                according to a sheriff’s report.</p>
